\title{Filter routes by spatial separation and ranking}
\usage{
filter_routes(
  routes,
  attribute_trips = c("bicycle_godutch", "quietness", "gradient_smooth"),
  buffer = 300,
  top_n = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{routes}{An sf object with route geometries and attributes}

\item{attribute_trips}{Attribute for ranking: "bicycle_godutch", "quietness", or "gradient_smooth"}

\item{buffer}{Minimum distance (meters) between route start points. Default: 300}

\item{top_n}{Maximum number of routes to return. Default: 3}
}
\value{
An sf object with filtered and ranked routes
}
\description{
Selects spatially separated routes based on start point distances and
ranks them by specified attributes for bike bus implementation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
rnet <- routes_network(routes_almada, "bicycle_godutch")
bike_routes <- cycle_bus_routes(routes_almada, rnet)
final_routes <- filter_routes(bike_routes, buffer = 500, top_n = 3)
}
