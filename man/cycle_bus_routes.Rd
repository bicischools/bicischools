\title{Create bicycle bus routes from route network}
\usage{
cycle_bus_routes(
  routes,
  rnet,
  min_trips = 0,
  attribute_trips = c("bicycle_godutch", "quietness", "gradient_smooth"),
  trips.col = names(routes)[grep("trip", names(routes))],
  buffer = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{routes}{An sf object with individual route geometries}

\item{rnet}{Route network created by routes_network()}

\item{min_trips}{Minimum threshold for attribute filtering. Default: 0}

\item{attribute_trips}{Attribute for scoring: "bicycle_godutch", "quietness", or "gradient_smooth"}

\item{trips.col}{Column name(s) for trip counts. Auto-detected by default.}

\item{buffer}{Buffer distance (meters) for spatial operations. Default: 10}
}
\value{
An sf object with bike bus routes sorted by distance-weighted scores
}
\description{
Identifies optimal bike bus routes by filtering high-demand network segments
and calculating distance-weighted scores for route prioritization.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
rnet <- routes_network(routes_almada, "bicycle_godutch")
bike_routes <- cycle_bus_routes(routes_almada, rnet, min_trips = 3)
}
