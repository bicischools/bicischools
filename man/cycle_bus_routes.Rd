\title{Create bicycle bus route network from individual routes}
\usage{
cycle_bus_routes(
  routes,
  min_trips = 0,
  attribute_trips = c("bicycle_godutch", "quietness", "gradient_smooth"),
  trips.col = names(routes)[grep("trip", names(routes))],
  buffer = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{routes}{An sf object with route geometries and cycling attributes.}

\item{min_trips}{Minimum threshold for attribute filtering. Default: 0.}

\item{attribute_trips}{Attribute for scoring: "bicycle_godutch", "quietness", or "gradient_smooth".}

\item{trips.col}{Column name(s) for trip counts. Auto-detected by default.}

\item{buffer}{Buffer distance (meters) for spatial operations. Default: 10.}
}
\value{
An sf object with optimized routes, sorted by distance-weighted scores.
Lower scores indicate higher priority routes.
}
\description{
Aggregates overlapping bicycle routes to identify high-demand corridors
suitable for bike bus implementation. Routes are scored by distance-weighted
cycling potential for prioritization.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage
bike_network <- cycle_bus_routes(routes_almada)

# High-potential routes only
priority_routes <- cycle_bus_routes(routes_almada, min_trips = 5, 
                                  attribute_trips = "bicycle_godutch")
