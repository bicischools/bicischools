\title{Calculate route statistics for bike bus planning}
\usage{
calc_stats(
  routes,
  rnet_plan,
  ordered_routes,
  attribute_trips = c("bicycle_godutch", "quietness", "gradient_smooth"),
  min_trips = 0,
  buffer = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{routes}{An sf object with individual routes}

\item{rnet_plan}{Route network from routes_network()}

\item{ordered_routes}{Prioritized routes from cycle_bus_routes()}

\item{attribute_trips}{Attribute for filtering: "bicycle_godutch", "quietness", or "gradient_smooth"}

\item{min_trips}{Minimum threshold for network filtering. Default: 0}

\item{buffer}{Buffer distance (meters) for spatial operations. Default: 10}
}
\value{
An sf object with route statistics including full_length, bike_bus_length, dist_to_bike_bus
}
\description{
Computes statistics for routes intersecting with bike bus corridors,
including full route length, bike bus segment length, and distance metrics.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
rnet <- routes_network(routes_almada, "bicycle_godutch")
bike_routes <- cycle_bus_routes(routes_almada, rnet)
stats <- calc_stats(routes_almada, rnet, bike_routes)
}
