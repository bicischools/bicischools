# bicischools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bicischools is to provide functions supporting development of 'bike bus' routes.

Work in progress...

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of bicischools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bicischools/bicischools")
```

<!-- ## Setup -->

<!-- The info below shows how we set-up the package. -->
```{r setup}
#| eval: false
# Create readme:
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
# get deps
getwd()
pkg_deps = renv::dependencies("code/case-study-school.R")
names(pkg_deps)
pkg_deps = as.data.frame(pkg_deps)
pkg_deps$Package
lapply(pkg_deps$Package, usethis::use_package)
# See if checks are happy now:
devtools::check()
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
